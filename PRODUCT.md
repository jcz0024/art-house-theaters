# Product Vision: Art House Movie Theaters Directory

## What This Is

The most comprehensive directory of independent and art house movie theaters in the United States. A resource for cinephiles to discover theaters showing foreign films, classic cinema, independent features, and repertory programming.

## Current State (v1.0)

- 347 theaters cataloged from Film Comment's 2015 comprehensive list
- Homepage displays all theaters
- City pages for major markets (LA, NYC, Chicago, Austin, etc.)
- Individual theater detail pages
- Basic search functionality

## Target Users

1. **Cinephiles** — Looking for theaters showing non-mainstream films
2. **Travelers** — Finding art house theaters in cities they're visiting
3. **Locals** — Discovering theaters in their area they didn't know about
